## Inference Executor
Inference Executor is an Android app for actualizing an inference pipeline generated by Inference Composer and optimizing its execution across devices. The runtime loads a saved inference pipeline from a JSON file, including loading classifiers from PMMLs, and instantiates the pipeline using Java implementations of inference modules available in a module library. The runtime partitions modules in a pipeline and considers different devices as targets for the execution. In this work, we consider the specific case of executing an inference between a smartwatch and a smartphone.

### Design
An `InferenceManager` (mobile or wear) runs on each device and is responsible for coordinating and managing the execution between devices. On each device, Inference Manager invokes an Inference Executor to load an Inference Pipeline from a JSON file, and to instantiate required Inference Module based on loaded parameter as well as existing modules in the current library.
