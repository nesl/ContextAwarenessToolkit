# Project Plan

### Design Goal
Create a toolkit to ease the development of context inference apps, achieving the following high-level goals:
* Assist the **collection of sensor data and ground truth labels** from user
* Automatically **compose the inference pipeline** from collected dataset, including the training and tuning of machine learning models
* Support **manual configuration** of the inference pipeline
* **Runtime optimization** of inference executions by partitioning the task across multiple devices and heterogeneous processors

### System Component
##### Data Collector
This is an Android app for helping developers collect a set of data from users, possibly including the ground truth label. The workflow is described as follows:

1. App developers specify the set of sensors to be considered, including:
  * Device: a smartphone, a smartwatch, or other external devices.
  * Sensor on each device:, e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, or a combination of multiple sensors.
  * Sensor configuration: e.g., frequency (limited by the device's sensing capabilities).
  * Ground truth configuration: if ground truth needs to be collected, what is the format of the ground truth label (e.g., nominal, real number, arbitrary string, etc.), and how frequently should the app query the user for labels.
  * Amount of data required: e.g., in terms of size, duration, number of certain ground truth labels, etc.
   
   The above information could be specified using a JSON file and then as an input to the Data Collector app. If time permits I will also develop the UI for configuration. 

2. Target users install the Data Collector app, which collects data based on the developer's configuration. The app runs continuously on the target user's phone and periodically query ground truth labels (if necessary) until the desired amount of data has been collected.

3. The Data Collector app and outputs the data, either to a file or to a cloud data storage service.

##### Inference Composer
This is a set of Python or Java APIs for assisting the composition of inference pipelines. 

##### Runtime Optimizer
This is an Android app for actualizing an inference pipeline generated by the Inference Composer and optimizing its execution across devices.
